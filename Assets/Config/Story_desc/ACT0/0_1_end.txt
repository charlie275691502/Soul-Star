Reacting to the weapon malfunction, Bichaer jumps back to dodge Sladeen's attack, then immediately forfeits to the referee.
#
Aside
But the referee pretends not to see and allows Sladeen to continue the attack, while Sladeen takes the opportunity to swing the mech sword towards Yigar.

You even managed to bribe the referee of a mech combat match?!

Damn it! You've already taken away all of the Yi family's assets, and now you want to wipe us out completely?

This kid has a lot of connections in the Mole Organization. If he grows up, he'll pose a major threat to the Chang family.

But with Yigar's current strength, his soul will probably be exhausted during the crossing process hahaha!

Seeing Yigar's evasion becoming increasingly difficult and his arm already slashed two or three times,

Bichaer suddenly rushes forward, throwing Yigar several meters back, and at the same time, gets stabbed in the abdomen from behind by Sladeen.

Bichaer flashes a provocative smile, then suddenly grabs the sword piercing his abdomen and pulls it upward with force.

Forget it, let's go, finding the location of the third base is more important.

Aside
The two leaving the arena fail to notice that, apart from the bodies, Bichaer's mech sword also turns into dots of light and gradually disappears.
